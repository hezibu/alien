## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Added .github directory to .Rbuildignore to fix the note:
  Found the following hidden files and directories:
   .github
  These were most likely included in error. See section 'Package
  structure' in the 'Writing R Extensions' manual.

  CRAN-pack does not know about
   .github

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 note

* This is a new release.
